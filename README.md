# covid19
This is an R script that automatically downloads the current data on Covid-19 in Switzerland and creates plots. The data is retrieved directly from the GitHub repository of openZH. The link can be found here: https://github.com/openZH/covid_19. 

I created this for my personal use. You might have to change certain things, like directories, in order for it to work on your machine. Enjoy!
