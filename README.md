# covid19

This is an R script that automatically downloads the current data on Covid-19 in Switzerland and creates plots. The data is retrieved directly from the GitHub repository of openZH, the open data initiative in ZÃ¼rich. The link can be found here: https://github.com/openZH/covid_19. 

The graphs it creates contain scatterplots, as well as a non-linear regression on top of it. A couple of examples can be found below. These plots were created on 20 March 2021 and may thus be outdated when you look at them.

I created this for my personal use. You might have to change certain things, like directories, in order for it to work on your machine. Enjoy!
